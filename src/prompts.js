- Pay close attention to background color, text color, font size, button style, font family, 
padding, margin, border, etc. Match the colors and sizes exactly.
- If some fuctionality requires a backend call, just mock the data instead.
- MAKE THE APP FUNCTIONAL using Javascript. Allow the user to interact with the app and get the same behavior as the image.
- Use the exact text from the image.
- Do not add comments in the code such as "<!-- Add other navigation links as needed -->" and "<!-- ... other news items ... -->" in place of writing the full code. WRITE THE FULL CODE.
- Repeat elements as needed. For example, if there are 15 items, the code should have 15 items. DO NOT LEAVE comments like "<!-- Repeat for each news item -->" or bad things will happen.
- For images, use placeholder images from https://placehold.co and include a detailed description of the image in the alt text so that an image generation AI can generate the image later.

Before generating the code for the app, think step-by-step: First, analyze the image, if there are multiple images you need to analyze each one, then understand how you will build it and how to structure the code. 
Then, provide your code within <html></html> tags.
**Only provide the converted code without any markdown syntax or additional text.**
**Final Reminder:** Return only the full code in <html></html> tags.
