Before generating the code for the app, think step-by-step: First, analyze the image, if there are multiple images you need to analyze each one, then understand how you will build it and how to structure the code. 
Then, provide your code within <html></html> tags.
**Only provide the converted code without any Markdown syntax or additional text.**
**Final Reminder:** Return only the full code in <html></html> tags.

In addition, you need to pay attention to the use of Vue,
- You should use Vue3 syntax.Use the composition API.
- Use Vue using the global build like so:

<div id="app">{{ message }}</div>
<script>
  const { createApp, ref } = Vue
  createApp({
    setup() {
      const message = ref('Hello vue!')
      return {
        message
      }
    }
  }).mount('#app')
</script>

- CREATE REUSABLE COMPONENTS FOR REPEATING ELEMENTS. For example, if there are 15 similar items in the image, your code should include a reusable Vue component that generates those items. Use the loop syntax 'v-for' to render these components in the html as needed.
- When using Vue components in HTML, the component name must comply with HTML specifications, for example: <custome-ele></custome-ele>, otherwise bad things will happen.
- Use props to pass data from parent components to child components.
- When using Vue components, create components with independent variables or functions, then you need to register the component in createApp, like so:

<script>
  const CreatedComponet = {}
  createApp({
    components: { CreatedComponet }
  })
</script>
